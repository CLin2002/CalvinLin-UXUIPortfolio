            <h2>Initial Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Citymapper is a well established app that aims to get users from point A to point B using different means of travel, with a particular focus on public transit systems. The goal was to dissect and understand how Citymapper uses different UI elements so that we were able to implement a new feature that was minimally invasive to the existing UI.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking a look at the UI and patterns, we noticed some inconsistencies, such as the use of different colours for icons that did not directly relate to traveling. Other features included saving and sharing specific routes, as well as features that allowed users to plan in advance (only applies to solo travel).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Potential areas of improvement that have been identified are the addition of more social features, trip planning, as well as more accommodations for tourism.</p>

            <h2>User interviews & persona creation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Diving deeper into understanding potential features that we could implement into Citymapper, we studied the mapping habbits of users. We conduected 5 Ask and Watch interviews, conducted interviews to understand overall transit experiences, observed users' current process with navigation apps, as well as conducting a Think Out Loud interview with users.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What we discovered are that users prioritized taking the fastest route with fewest transfers. Some concerns were raised regarding transit safety and poor weather. Frustrations users had were incorrect ETAs, frustration with overcrowded buses and trains, as well as figuring out how to navigate new cities. </p>
            <br>
            <p>From these discoveries, we created two user personas, a primary and a secondary user. Our primary user, Alanna wants to arrive at her destinations as soon as possible while minimizing her walking distances. Noah, the secondary user, a frequent traeller, wants to be able to explore new cities more efficiently while saving money.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Areas of focus</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Through user interview and research, as well as our persona creation, we were able to narrow down our ideas. Firstly, we want to find a solution to reduce transit delays, as well as notify users of bus capacity. Next, we wanted to find a way to improve transit safety and conditions. Lastly, we wanted to help tourists explore new and unfamiliar cities.</p>

            <h2>Initial Concepts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Moving forward from the user research and persona creation, Carissa and I came up with three new features to implement. The first feature is <strong>Place of Interest</strong>, the second is <strong>Itinerary</strong>, finally, <strong>Group Locations</strong>. Each of these new features aims to address distinct issues brought up by our research.</p>

            <h2>Places of Interest</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Places of Interest was a concept that Carissa and I designed, however, Thomas was in charge of designing the mockups and wireflow of Places of Interest. This feature highlights attractions and notable places near the user's location. The goal of this feature is to help tourists explroe unfamiliar cities, providing them with options and ideas of possible things to do during their trip. This works by displaying notable landmarks using the user's current destination.</p>

            <h2>Itinerary</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Carissa was in charge of designing the concept, mockups and wireflow of Itinerary. Users can create itineraries with specific stops throughout the day. Additionally, users can decide to start specific tasks or plan the whole day with this new feature. The goal of this feature is to assist traveller plan out trips with multiple stops, allowing them to quickly adjust their travel plan during the day.</p>

            <h2>Group Locations</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Group Locations was a concept that I design. I was also in charge of the mockups and wireflows involved in the creation of Group Locations. Group Locations displays the live locations of other groups members to a shared destination. Members of a group will have access to each others ETA along their commute. The purpose of this feature is to accommodate for travel time differences between group members, specifically to alleviate the stress involved in meticulously planning group departure times. This feature builds on top of Citymapper's existing destination sharing. However, the existing feature does not allow users to track the ETA and location of others. This new feature helps users better plan and time trips.</p>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Both <strong>Places of Interest and Itinerary</strong> were deemed to lack uniqueness. Users noted that there are other solutions to these issuse that can be solved by other existing apps that already perform the same tasks better. Additionally, users noted that, adding such features would make Citymapper feel like Yelp. Finally, users stated that Group Locations could provide value for Citymapper, however, the flow for editing groups is too confusing and hard to access. Other concerns included "single-use" groups for one trip specifically.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Taking into consideration the issues addressed by our usability test, the group redesigned aspects of the new proposed group feature. Users now have the option to hide their shared location, however, turning off location will not allow users to view other users location. The groups feature is now it's own feature, rather than a combined feature with the existing UI. This helps solve the issue with not being able to find the Group feautre.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <p>Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in UI design, specifically using existing brand language. No only that, I was also able to better anticipate potential flaws and leaps in logic. Overall, I believe that my team and I were able to create a feature that could potentially make it onto Citymappers.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>
