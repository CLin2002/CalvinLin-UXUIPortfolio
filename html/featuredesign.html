            <p>Accommodate for travel time differences for group members with different starting points. Alleviate the stress of planning group departure times and ETA uncertainty.</p>

            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Planning a trip with a large group can be challenging and confusing. Differences in travel times can make it difficult to predict when members of the group will arrive. This issue becomes magnified when the uncertainty of transit schedules becomes involved.</p>

            <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our first task was to gain insights into how users currently planned their travels. We found that most users prioritized the fastest, most efficient transit routes. Users of Google and Apple maps noted that ETAs are unreliable and often inaccurate, further explaining how these issues cause stress, especially when traveling to unfamiliar places such as new cities.</p>

            <h2>Proposing a New Feature</h2>
            <br>
            <p>From the insights we gathered, one of the three main features that we planned on implementing is the Group ETA feature. My role was to plan and design the wireframe and wireflows. This new feature faced logistical errors initially, and we received valuable feedback about user privacy. Additionally, we identified that leaving a group required too many steps, and the new feature lacked clarity and visibility on the home page.</p>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>During our think-aloud interviews, users expressed mixed feelings about the new feature. Some users found forming new groups for each trip cumbersome, while others felt the process of leaving groups was tedious and frustrating. One user stated, "I feel uneasy commuting alone, so I will let someone know once I get to my destination as a way to check-in." Another noted, "When traveling with friends, we would set a meet-up point during the day. Sometimes I would have to wait a while if I got there first." Overall, we found that users were more than happy to see this feature implemented in Citymapper, believing that the new feature would improve their transit experience.</p>

            <h2>Final Mockup</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The final mockup introduced a more robust visual hierarchy for the Group ETA feature, greatly improving clarity. Although user privacy concerns were not initially raised, it was important for our team to present users with the option to opt out of sharing locations based on their discretion. To address the lengthy process of leaving a group, we incorporated the new feature on the main page of Citymapper.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Designing for an existing platform is difficult.</strong> The most difficult part of this project was to develop a feature that enhanced the existing user experience without compromising the original integrity of the app.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Privacy is important.</strong> Protecting user data and being transparent about information sharing should always be a top priority in design.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>The feature should be easily accessible.</strong>  Any valuable feature should be instantly recognizable and easily accessible. Users should not need to navigate through multiple screens to perform a task.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

            <p>Identify issues through interviews and trying to discover the root cause of user issues Think aloud method of running through final UI to determine any holes in logic Through refining our idea, we were able to further explore Citymapperâ€™s brand identity and studying their UI elements to better incorporate our feature. We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <p>Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in UI design, specifically using existing brand language. No only that, I was also able to better anticipate potential flaws and leaps in logic. Overall, I believe that my team and I were able to create a feature that could potentially make it onto Citymappers.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>

            <!-- <h2>Learning Citymapper's UI habbits</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Citymapper is a well established app that aims to get users from point A to point B using different means of travel, with a particular focus on public transit systems. The goal was to dissect and understand how Citymapper uses different UI elements so that we were able to implement a new feature that was minimally invasive to the existing UI.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking a look at the UI and patterns, we noticed some inconsistencies, such as the use of different colours for icons that did not directly relate to traveling. Other features included saving and sharing specific routes, as well as features that allowed users to plan in advance (only applies to solo travel).</p>
