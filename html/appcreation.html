                <br>
                <p>Big ED is a charitable organization that aims to suppot education worldwide. Our goal is to encourage more people to donate to charitable causes by offering convenience and transparency throughout our app.</p>

            <h2>Where do I being with donating...?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Where do I begin with donating?", a common question asked by many first time donors. Big ED's goal is to create a frictionless experience for both new and experienced users in the domain of donations, specifically for education. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our aim was to tackle the main reasons users may not want to donate: <strong>lack of transparency, overwhelming choices, and feeling like their contributions are not worth much</strong>. By offering the choice between physical item donations and monetary donations, we hope to leverage different types of donors. In addition, users will also have the choice to set up recurring donations for campaigns they feel passionate about.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the course of this project, my specific task was to focus on the <strong>Donations</strong> page. My priority was to ensure that users had easy access to all the information that they would expect.</p>

            <h2>Researching other charities (learning the do's and don't's)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Any time a charity is asking for money, they better be very convincing or offer a cause that donors can stand behind. Emotional leverage and transparency are two very important factors in the success of a charity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through the team and my own research, we have found that personal values, a sense of duty, as well as creating a lasting impact are some of the main goals that donors have. We found that, no matter how noble or effective a charity may be, if donors do not share the same values, they often do not donate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This led our team into narrowing down our ideas into three specific areas of interest. First, we wanted to create a direct pick-up app that allowed users to more easily donate physical items. secondly, we designed a pen-pal system that allowed donors to more directly impact the lives of specific recipients. Finally, an emergency relief charity that focused on feminine hygeine products, an area that is often overlooked. </p>

            <h2>From high level to low level concepts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Some concerns that were raised were: <strong>is this specific enough? does this provide value for users? and what charities do we include in our software?</strong> As we pondered and reflected on what kinds of donations may bring value to donors, we decided on the idea of education. We thought about the wide range of school supplies that many people already have at home and would like to donate, as well as passionate individuals who want to support the next generation of learners.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With a reformed goal in mind, we set out to begin our first wireflow. I was able to complete the wireflow for tracking donated items, as well as the history of donations. Tracking donations aims to solve the issue of a lack of transparency displayed by other charities, as well, the history page provided insights on how a donor's donation impacted the recipients.</p>

            <br>
            <p>With a new direction in mind, we began developing our style guide. This consisted of our colour palette, type, as well as interactive elements. Using the style guide, we maintained a high level of standard and consistency throughout all of our pages. At this stage, I was able to further refine the <strong>Donations</strong> page to better suit user needs.</p>

            <br>
            <p>During usability testing, I was able to gather valuable insights from my interview. First was that, despite believing that features such as live-tracking of donations was a valuable feature,  users noted that it was not essential to their overall experience. Secondly, users found the <strong>subscription and history page to be too similar</strong>. There were some other hierarchy issues as well, such as important text that is easy to miss.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Group Locations was a concept that I design. I was also in charge of the mockups and wireflows involved in the creation of Group Locations. Group Locations displays the live locations of other groups members to a shared destination. Members of a group will have access to each others ETA along their commute. The purpose of this feature is to accommodate for travel time differences between group members, specifically to alleviate the stress involved in meticulously planning group departure times. This feature builds on top of Citymapper's existing destination sharing. However, the existing feature does not allow users to track the ETA and location of others. This new feature helps users better plan and time trips.</p>

Notably, Group Locations leverages existing features offered by Citymapper and helps enhance the current feature. Group Locations however, was not without its flaws. There were many patches in logic and overall usability that still needed to be thought out and refined. The team spent a week refining and patching holes in logic with this feature.</p>

            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>
