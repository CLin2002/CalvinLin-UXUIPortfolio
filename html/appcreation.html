                <br>
                <p>Big ED is a charitable organization that aims to suppot education worldwide. Our goal is to encourage more people to donate to charitable causes by offering convenience and transparency throughout our app.</p>

            <h2>Initial Research Summary</h2>
            <br>
                <p><strong>Research Goals:</strong> To develop an understanding of the domain of charitable donations, identify user behaviours and potential high friction areas that prevent users from donating. </p>
            <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Research Findings:</strong>
                    During the initial research phase, my group and I determined factors that discouraged potential donors. Most notably, <strong>lack of transparency, the feeling of their contributions being insignificant, as well as an overwhelming amount of choices</strong> make potential donors anxious about making their first donation.
                </p>
            <br>
                <p>Our proposed app will solve the listed issues by offering extensive breakdowns of how donations are used, quantifying community donations to highlight impact, as well as specifically tailor towards a niche so users have an easy time understanding what they are donating to. Based on these solutions, as a team we developed a primary and secondary user persona and I designed our experience maps.</p>

            <h2>Initial Concepts and Ideas</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 1: Pen-pal donation</strong>
                <br>
                A pen-pal donation system allows donors to donate to specific individuals from other parts of the world. Donors can connect with recipients one on one and develop a stronger connection with one another. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 2: Direct pick-up</strong>
                <br>
                A direct pick-up system aims to enable donors to quickly and easily request a donation pick-up directly from their doorstep, without the need of traveling to physical locations to drop-off donations. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 3: Emergency Relief</strong>
                <br>
                Discover and connect with emergency relief requests put out by registered organizations and governments. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Refined Concept: </strong>
                <br>
                A charity organization that focuses on supporting all levels of education for students worldwide. Achieve this by offering different campaigns, donation transparency and convenience for donors.

            <h3>Refinement and style guide</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As we moved forward, to maintain brand language and consistency, we developed our own style guide. This consisted of our colour palette, type, as well as interactive elements. Using the style guide, we maintained a high level of standard and consistency throughout all of our pages. My personal contributions included working with our type and brand colours. At this stage, I was able to further refine the <strong>Donations</strong> page to better represent BigED.</p>

            <p>Our first completed mockup and prototype included <strong>Onboarding</strong>, as well as <strong>News, Discover, Profile, and Donations pages</strong>.

Using Figma, I designed the <strong>Donations</strong> page, including all of the appropriate interactions.</p>

            <h2>Usability testing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>During usability testing, I was able to gather valuable insights from my interview. First was that, despite believing that features such as live-tracking of donations was a valuable feature, users noted that it was not essential to their overall experience. Secondly, users found the <strong>subscription and history page to be too similar</strong>. There were some other hierarchy issues as well, such as important text that is easy to miss.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I sorted all of the data gathered by my team, with important insights under its respective sub-page in our app. Breaking down concerns and issues with our first iteration, the entire team brainstormed potential solutions and opportunities that could be implemented in our final prototype.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With new insights in mind, I began implementing changes to the Donations page. This included merging the Subscription and History page, making it an extensive list of all active and past donations, as well as correcting issues in hierarchy within the Tracking page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The major changes made to the Donations page was to combine both subscription and history into a centralized <strong>Donation</strong> tab. The combination of the tabs was to help centralize information, making the overall user-experience more postiive. In addition, limiting the amount of information offered helped reduce the cognitive load put upon the users in the previous iteration.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app. 
            </p>

        <div class="item">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            <br>
            <p>
            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
