                <br>
                <p>Big ED is a charitable organization that aims to suppot education worldwide. Our goal is to encourage more people to donate to charitable causes by offering convenience and transparency throughout our app.</p>

            <h2>Where do I being with donating...?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Where do I begin with donating?", a common question asked by many first time donors. Big ED's goal is to create a frictionless experience for both new and experienced users in the domain of donations, specifically for education. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our aim was to tackle the main reasons users may not want to donate: <strong>lack of transparency, overwhelming choices, and feeling like their contributions are not worth much</strong>. By offering the choice between physical item donations and monetary donations, we hope to leverage different types of donors. In addition, users will also have the choice to set up recurring donations for campaigns they feel passionate about.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the course of this project, my specific task was to focus on the <strong>Donations</strong> page. My priority was to ensure that users had easy access to all the information that they would expect.</p>

            <h2>Researching other charities (learning the do's and don't's)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Any time a charity is asking for money, they better be very convincing or offer a cause that donors can stand behind. Emotional leverage and transparency are two very important factors in the success of a charity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through the team and my own research, we have found that personal values, a sense of duty, as well as creating a lasting impact are some of the main goals that donors have. We found that, no matter how noble or effective a charity may be, if donors do not share the same values, they often do not donate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This led our team into narrowing down our ideas into three specific areas of interest. First, we wanted to create a direct pick-up app that allowed users to more easily donate physical items. secondly, we designed a pen-pal system that allowed donors to more directly impact the lives of specific recipients. Finally, an emergency relief charity that focused on feminine hygeine products, an area that is often overlooked. </p>

            <h2>From high level to low level concepts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Some concerns that were raised were: <strong>is this specific enough? does this provide value for users? and what charities do we include in our software?</strong> As we pondered and reflected on what kinds of donations may bring value to donors, we decided on the idea of education. We thought about the wide range of school supplies that many people already have at home and would like to donate, as well as passionate individuals who want to support the next generation of learners.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With a reformed goal in mind, we set out to begin our first wireflow. I was able to complete the wireflow for tracking donated items, as well as the history of donations. Tracking donations aims to solve the issue of a lack of transparency displayed by other charities, as well, the history page provided insights on how a donor's donation impacted the recipients.</p>

            <p>With a new direction in mind, we began developing our style guide. This consisted of our colour palette, type, as well as interactive elements. Using the style guide, we maintained a high level of standard and consistency throughout all of our pages. At this stage, I was able to further refine the <strong>Donations</strong> page to better suit user needs.</p>

            <br>
            <p>During usability testing, I was able to gather valuable insights from my interview. First was that, despite believing that features such as live-tracking of donations was a valuable feature,  users noted that it was not essential to their overall experience. Secondly, users found the <strong>subscription and history page to be too similar</strong>. There were some other hierarchy issues as well, such as important text that is easy to miss.</p>

            <p>The major changes made to the Donations page was to combine both subscription and history into a centralized <strong>Donation</strong> tab. The combination of the tabs was to help centralize information, making the overall user-experience more postiive. In addition, limiting the amount of information offered helped reduce the cognitive load put upon the users in the previous iteration.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app.

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            <p>
            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <br>
            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
