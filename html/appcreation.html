                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Big ED is a charity app focusing on education development, a project designed and executed by my team and me. Our goal was to address the challenges many new users encounter when deciding how to make donations. The app's premise is simple: it helps users choose a cause to support while providing all the necessary information for informed decisions. Our mission was to remove the barriers that deter users from contributing to those in need.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Making your first donation can be a daunting experience. Users often face a multitude of options and must conduct extensive research to find the charity that aligns with their values and goals. Big ED was created to alleviate the stress associated with charitable giving, catering to both new and experienced donors. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our goals were to: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simplify the donation process.</li>
                        <li>Provide a solution for recurring donors.</li>
                        <li>Design a platform that offers comprehensive information.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
            <br>
                <p>In our initial research, we sought to understand why users hesitated to donate. We discovered that 60% of young adults believed seeing the direct impact of their donations would significantly influence their giving decisions. Drawing from a <a href="https://medium.com/@FlorentGeerts/the-jam-experiment-how-choice-overloads-makes-consumers-buy-less-d610f8c37b9b" target="_blank"><strong>famous study by Columbia University </strong></a>, we learned that too many options can overwhelm users and reduce successful donations. Big ED's mission became clear: to create a platform that effectively addresses these challenges and welcomes donors.

            <h2>Wireframing The Solution</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To address the identified issues, I worked on two key aspects: the donation tracking page and co-designed the discovery page with Jasper. The donation tracking page aimed to allow users to monitor their donations from initiation to completion, promoting transparency. The discovery page was designed to provide users with all the essential information to conduct thorough research on campaigns.

            <h2>Usability testing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To ensure the usability and effectiveness of the Big ED charity app, we conducted rigorous usability testing, employing a combination of the think-aloud method and A/B testing. This approach allowed us to gain valuable insights into user interactions and preferences.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <br>
            <p>From our usability testing efforts, we uncovered several critical issues and insights:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Transparency of Supporters:</strong> Users expressed concerns about the lack of transparency on the discovery page. They found it challenging to determine the number of supporters backing a campaign. This ambiguity led to uncertainty and impacted their decision-making.</li>
                <li><Strong>Size and Interactivity:</Strong> Users encountered difficulties with the discovery page filters and cards. They perceived them as too small and not easily interactive. These usability issues hindered users' ability to explore and engage with campaigns effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Donation Tracking:</strong> The donation tracking system was a source of confusion for users. It appeared disconnected from the rest of the app, making it challenging for users to understand the status of their donations and whether they had been fulfilled.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>       
        <div class="gutter-right">

            <h2>A/B Testing Insights</h2>
            <br>
            <p>During A/B tests, users provided valuable feedback on the use of color within the app. While overall color did not significantly impact the user experience, users expressed a preference for yellow buttons related to monetary functions. Yellow was associated more strongly with money in users' minds compared to the color blue.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Iterative Design:</strong> Armed with these insights, we prioritized design improvements to address these issues in subsequent iterations. By enhancing transparency, optimizing screen size and interactivity, and refining the donation tracking system, we aimed to create a more user-friendly and intuitive app.</p>

            <h2>Final Mockup</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Incorporating user feedback from usability testing, I made critical adjustments to improve the user experience. The donation tracking was separated into active and completed donations, offering users clear insights into their donation status. The discovery page introduced a drop-down filter for enhanced usability. The cards on the discovery page were redesigned to be more linear, accommodating larger thumbnail images and more campaign information.</p>
            <!-- <br>
            <p>The major changes made to the Donations page was to combine both subscription and history into a centralized <strong>Donation</strong> tab. The combination of the tabs was to help centralize information, making the overall user-experience more postiive. In addition, limiting the amount of information offered helped reduce the cognitive load put upon the users in the previous iteration.</p> -->

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> Users value quality campaigns that make a meaningful impact more than being overwhelmed by numerous options. Prioritizing user needs allowed us to create an outstanding user experience and product. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Respect what users’ say.</strong> Our research findings were invaluable to our project's success. Listening to users' feedback was crucial, and we considered it carefully throughout the design process.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Let users’ make their own decisions</strong> Big ED's primary objective was to provide users with a positive experience and empower them to make informed decisions. We offered complete campaign breakdowns, allowing users to decide whether to donate.

            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app. 
            </p>

        <div class="item">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
