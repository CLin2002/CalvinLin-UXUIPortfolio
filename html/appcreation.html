            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Big ED is a charity app focusing on education development, a project designed and executed by my team and me. Our goal was to address the challenges many new users encounter when deciding how to make donations. The app's premise is simple: it helps users choose a cause to support while providing all the necessary information for informed decisions. Our mission was to remove the barriers that deter users from contributing to those in need.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Making your first donation can be a daunting experience. Users often face a multitude of options and must conduct extensive research to find the charity that aligns with their values and goals. Big ED was created to alleviate the stress associated with charitable giving, catering to both new and experienced donors.

            <br>
            <p>In our initial research, we sought to understand why users hesitated to donate. We discovered that <strong>60% of young adults</strong> believed seeing the direct impact of their donations would significantly influence their giving decisions. We learned that too many options can overwhelm users and reduce successful donations.</p>

            <br>
            <p>From the insights we gathered, one of the three main features that we planned on implementing is the Group ETA feature. My role was to plan and design the wireframe and wireflows. This new feature faced logistical errors initially, and we received valuable feedback about user privacy. Additionally, we identified that leaving a group required too many steps, and the new feature lacked clarity and visibility on the home page.</p>

            <h2>Framing The Approach </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Through these insights, a follow-up interview with 6 inexperienced donors was conducted by the team to understand the behaviours surrounding philanthropy. From our research it became evident that the issues potential donors faced were the fact that one-time donors did not feel that their contributions were significant as they could not correlate their donations to a tangible goal. 
                <br><br>
                This greatly influenced our framing of <strong>“How might we help a potential donor understand the impacts of their donation?” </strong>

            <p>Within Big ED’s app interface, new users can expect transparent campaigns that highlight how every contribution impacts their community. Additionally, users will be able to track their physical donations from start to finish. <strong>By being transparent, users will clearly see the impact of their donations, empowering potential donors to create their first donation, allowing them to easily research campaigns at their own pace.</strong>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Users value quality campaigns that make a meaningful impact more than being overwhelmed by numerous options. Prioritizing user needs allowed us to create an outstanding user experience and product.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Respect what users’ say. </strong>Our research findings were invaluable to our project's success. Listening to users' feedback was crucial, and we considered it carefully throughout the design process.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Let users’ make their own decisions.</strong> Big ED's primary objective was to provide users with a positive experience and empower them to make informed decisions. We offered complete campaign breakdowns, allowing users to decide whether to donate.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>

            <!-- <h2>Learning Citymapper's UI habbits</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Citymapper is a well established app that aims to get users from point A to point B using different means of travel, with a particular focus on public transit systems. The goal was to dissect and understand how Citymapper uses different UI elements so that we were able to implement a new feature that was minimally invasive to the existing UI.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking a look at the UI and patterns, we noticed some inconsistencies, such as the use of different colours for icons that did not directly relate to traveling. Other features included saving and sharing specific routes, as well as features that allowed users to plan in advance (only applies to solo travel).</p>
