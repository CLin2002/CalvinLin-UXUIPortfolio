            <br>
            <p>Uncover the hidden processes in mobile devices known as <strong>phone daemons</strong> and identify how to confront the issue in a non-traditional and speculative manner. Design a speculative design solution to combat <strong>phone daemons</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In computing, <strong>daemons</strong> are background processes that operate silently, performing specific tasks without requiring user interaction. Extending this metaphor to modern smartphones, phone daemons are invisible digital agents that monitor and influence user behaviour without explicit consent or awareness. However since the introduction of the smartphone, it has secretly changed the way we live our lives specifically with our daily social interactions.

            <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To uncover the meaning behind phone daemons, our group conducted extensive background research on the topic. We explored technical definitions of phone daemons, as well as the implications of them. I focused on the biological aspect of how phone daemons and phone addiction can affect the biology of developing brains. <br><br>

            <br>
            <p>From the insights we gathered, one of the three main features that we planned on implementing is the Group ETA feature. My role was to plan and design the wireframe and wireflows. This new feature faced logistical errors initially, and we received valuable feedback about user privacy. Additionally, we identified that leaving a group required too many steps, and the new feature lacked clarity and visibility on the home page.</p>

            <p>During A/B tests, users provided valuable feedback on the use of color within the app. While overall color did not significantly impact the user experience, users expressed a preference for yellow buttons related to monetary functions. Yellow was associated more strongly with money in users' minds compared to the color blue.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Iterative Design:</strong> Armed with these insights, we prioritized design improvements to address these issues in subsequent iterations. By enhancing transparency, optimizing screen size and interactivity, and refining the donation tracking system, we aimed to create a more user-friendly and intuitive app.</p>

            <p>Incorporating user feedback from usability testing, I made critical adjustments to improve the user experience. The donation tracking was separated into active and completed donations, offering users clear insights into their donation status. The discovery page introduced a drop-down filter for enhanced usability. The cards on the discovery page were redesigned to be more linear, accommodating larger thumbnail images and more campaign information.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Users value quality campaigns that make a meaningful impact more than being overwhelmed by numerous options. Prioritizing user needs allowed us to create an outstanding user experience and product.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Respect what users’ say. </strong>Our research findings were invaluable to our project's success. Listening to users' feedback was crucial, and we considered it carefully throughout the design process.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Let users’ make their own decisions.</strong> Big ED's primary objective was to provide users with a positive experience and empower them to make informed decisions. We offered complete campaign breakdowns, allowing users to decide whether to donate.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Identify issues through interviews and trying to discover the root cause of user issues Think aloud method of running through final UI to determine any holes in logic Through refining our idea, we were able to further explore Citymapper’s brand identity and studying their UI elements to better incorporate our feature. We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <p>Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in UI design, specifically using existing brand language. No only that, I was also able to better anticipate potential flaws and leaps in logic. Overall, I believe that my team and I were able to create a feature that could potentially make it onto Citymappers.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>
