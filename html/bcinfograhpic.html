            <p>Reading lengthy, dense factsheets can be tedious and time-consuming, especially for farmers and producers who often have little time to spare. This challenge is even more pronounced during the busy summer season when production takes precedence.

            <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our first task was to gain insights into how users currently planned their travels. We found that most <strong>users felt unsafe on public transit, especially at night.</strong> Users of Google and Apple maps noted that <strong>ETAs are unreliable and often inaccurate,</strong> emphasizing that planning a trip with multiple participants can be daunting and time-consuming.</p>

            <br>
            <p>From the insights we gathered, one of the three main features that we planned on implementing is the Group ETA feature. My role was to plan and design the wireframe and wireflows. This new feature faced logistical errors initially, and we received valuable feedback about user privacy. Additionally, we identified that leaving a group required too many steps, and the new feature lacked clarity and visibility on the home page.</p>

            <h2>Framing The Approach </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Drawing from the insights we gathered, we devised plans on developing a new feature that Citymapper could implement to address the issues that users faced when using public transit. <strong>It became evident that even experienced transit riders could not optimize their schedule as ETAs are often unreliable. </strong>
                <br><br>
                This informed our framing of <strong>“How might we streamline group trips by removing the time-consuming planning phase?” </strong>

            <h2>Introducing Citymapper Group ETA </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Embedded within Citymapper’s existing interface, Group ETA is a feature that plans the most optimal route for users within the same group. <strong>By providing a unique route for different members of a group, it minimizes potential wait times, allowing users to focus on the day ahead of them, rather than on waiting. </strong>
                <br><br>
                Throughout the implementation of this feature, I was responsible for designing the concept, interface design, as well as contribute towards our usability tests.

            <br>
            <p><strong>Designing for an existing platform is difficult.</strong> The most difficult part of this project was to develop a feature that enhanced the existing user experience without compromising the original integrity of the app.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Privacy is important.</strong> Protecting user data and being transparent about information sharing should always be a top priority in design.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>The feature should be easily accessible.</strong>  Any valuable feature should be instantly recognizable and easily accessible. Users should not need to navigate through multiple screens to perform a task.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>
