            <br>
            <p>Develop a comprehensive overview of project funding and timelines by designing and producing visually engaging and easily comprehensible infographics. Ensure these infographics effectively communicate key project milestones, funding sources, and financial allocations to both public and internal audiences, and are completed within specified timeframes for each phase.</p>

            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Reading lengthy, dense factsheets can be tedious and time-consuming, especially for farmers and producers who have limited time, particularly during busy seasons. The challenge was to create straightforward and impactful infographics that effectively engage this audience.</p>

            <p>Our research revealed that lengthy and complex factsheets often deter the target audience from engaging with the content. To address this, <strong>we identified the need to design infographics that balance visual appeal with essential information.</strong> We aimed to streamline content to retain viewer attention and focus on key details.</p>

            <br>
            <p>From the insights we gathered, one of the three main features that we planned on implementing is the Group ETA feature. My role was to plan and design the wireframe and wireflows. This new feature faced logistical errors initially, and we received valuable feedback about user privacy. Additionally, we identified that leaving a group required too many steps, and the new feature lacked clarity and visibility on the home page.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Effective Use of Graphic Design Elements:</strong> Integrating visual tools such as pie charts and timelines enhanced the clarity and impact of the infographics. Pie charts conveyed financial data at a glance, while timelines illustrated project milestones engagingly.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Design and Text Hierarchy:</strong> Employing design hierarchy and strategic use of text was crucial in emphasizing important points and guiding the viewer's focus. Clear headings, varied font sizes, and visual contrasts highlighted key details and ensured that critical information stood out.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Audience-Centric Visual Strategies:</strong>  Tailoring visual strategies to the specific needs of farmers and producers ensured that the infographics were engaging and functional. Streamlining content through effective visual design and prioritizing readability helped make complex information accessible and actionable for a time-constrained audience.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.</p>

            <p>Identify issues through interviews and trying to discover the root cause of user issues Think aloud method of running through final UI to determine any holes in logic Through refining our idea, we were able to further explore Citymapper’s brand identity and studying their UI elements to better incorporate our feature. We also meticulously planned our various wire-flows in order to create a robust system that considered many use cases. Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.</p>

            <p>Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in UI design, specifically using existing brand language. No only that, I was also able to better anticipate potential flaws and leaps in logic. Overall, I believe that my team and I were able to create a feature that could potentially make it onto Citymappers.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.</p>
