            <h2>Initial User Research Summary</h2>
            <br>
                <p><strong>Research Goals:</strong> Identify potential pitfalls in TERAs BEAN's current business operation by observing how customers interact with the staff and physical space. Additionally, conduct user research to further strengthen hypothesis' to build a solution.</p>
            <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Research Findings:</strong>
                A large customer segment that is not being catered towards are students and customers who work at cafes. Additionally, TERAs BEAN does not feel inclusive for potential customers as the menu is hidden and menu items are poorly advertised. 
                </p>
            <br>
                <p>The solution that we developed was an online seat booking system. This system would allow students, a large customer segment to book a seat online to better plan their studies. This alleviates some of the pain that can come with not knowing whether or not seating is available. Additionally, customers are better able to plan around their own needs such as outlets and potential noise factors.</p>

            <h2>Initial Concepts and Ideas</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 1: Digital Catalogue</strong>
                <br>
                Create a digital solution to help customers navigate the extensive catalogue at TERAs BEAN. The new TERAs BEAN digital catalogue will allow customers to order baked goods ahead of time, as well as inform customers about potential dietary restrictions. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 2: Interactive Kiosk</strong>
                <br>
                A kiosk inside TERAs BEAN that would allow customers to explore the menu at their own pace. 
                <br>
                The interactive kiosk experience will allow new and experienced customers to browse through the menu to avoid waiting in line. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Concept 3: Featured Menu</strong>
                <br>
                To encourage customers to explore the product offerings by TERAs Bean, a digital Featured Menu will be displayed outside of the cafe. 
                <br>    
                This interactive digital experience will entice and attract passerby's and indecisive customers to explore new drinks and products offerings and will increase foot traffic into the cafe. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Refined Concept: Online Booking</strong>
                <br>
                During our ethnographic study, an overlooked opportunity that was presented to us was related to the idea of cafe seating. This was also an opportunity we had previously overlooked during the creation of our design concepts.
                <br>
                This meant that this design solution was within the scope of our research.

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As a team, we created a workshop to collect data from university students to better understand what their study habits and preferences were. What we included in this workshop were a <strong>short questionnaire, a brainstorm collage, study space tier list, as well as speed ideating</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <strong>What we found</strong> was that users tend to prefer natural lighting, and white light for the interior lights. Additionally, different seating options are highly valued as users noted that they rarely study alone. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Gathering all of the collected data, I sorted the information into data that would be relevant to our design solution. This included data on what was already done at TERAs BEAN that is already working, what could change, as well as user trends. Additionally, I arranged the brainstorm into <strong>must-have and nice-to-have</strong> categories. The arrangement considered physical features of workspaces.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Using the data that I organized, Matthew and Noah designed a tablet and desktop interface. The desktop handled the online reservations on the user side, while the tablet was the in-house system to notify customers whether or not a table was reserved or free.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app. 
            </p>
        </div>       
        <div class="item">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
