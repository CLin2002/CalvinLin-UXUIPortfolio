            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Running an independent coffee shop is a monumental task. Pitted against giant corporations, TERAs BEAN needed a simple, effective solution to better cater towards their target audience, university students. TERAs BEANs priority is to create a welcoming, engaging space for not only university students, but everybody who walks through their doors. </p>

            </h2>
            <br>
                <p>During the initial research phase, Matthew, Alexandra, and myself visited TERAs BEAN as observers to gain an understanding to how customers interacted with staff and the physical space. What we found were that, most customers were either studying or on their laptops doing work. We observed potential customers walking in and leaving without ordering. This was due to the small and easy to miss menu, as well as the lack of presence on different media platforms. </p>

            <h2>User Ethnography </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Reflecting on our initial insights, we created two personas: Noah Osborne, a busy student, and Bella Crocker, a cafe lounger. Thinking about how TERAs BEAN attracts a lot of students and workers, we created these personas to reflect and streamline the user experiences for the largest demographic of TERAs BEAN.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Moving on from the personas, Noah, Matthew, Jasper and myself worked on creating a user journey map. Drawing from our research, we mapped out a typical visit to TERAs BEAN would look like for Noah, the student. We identified potential pain points and positive experiences to assist in developing our solution.

            <h2>User Participatory Workshop
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>As a team, we designed and conducted a participatory workshop with SFU students to identify their needs and frustrations when studying. This workshop consisted of four parts, an initial screening done on Google Forms, moodboard creations, study space tier lists, and speed ideation. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                What we found was that students at SFU seldomly study alone and valued seating variety. Additionally outlets, good hygiene, and good lighting (with an emphasis on large windows and natural light) were must haves. Users heavily disliked cubicles and areas that encourage foot traffic. Additionally, external distractions such as loud music were deal breakers. 
            </p>
            <br> 
            <p>In addition to leading the workshop, I also compiled all the research. I sorted the research into subsections to further highlight user trends and pain points.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution </h2>
            <br>
            <p>The table reservation system that we designed helped reduce the uncertainty that users can face when finding study spaces. This solution allows users to choose in areas with more environmental lighting, avoid areas with a lot of foot traffic, as well as accommodate for different party sizes. Our interface provides all relevant details, notifying users whether a seat had access to windows for natural light, outlets, as well as the seating capacity.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Listen to the users.</strong> One of the biggest contributing factors to our project’s success was our ability to listen to the users and learn from them what’s working and what’s not. Our users gave us invaluable insight into different factors that affect their experiences, many in which we had never thought of initially. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Create trust with the client.</strong> Communication was key when working with external parties. We prioritized the goals of both our client TERAs BEAN, as well as other stakeholders such as the customers. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>First impressions matter.</strong> TERAs BEAN was an external party that did not need to accept an offer to work with our team. Rather, it was because we made a good first impression that TERAs BEAN trusted us to develop a solution that could help improve their already great business. </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app.

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            <p>
            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
