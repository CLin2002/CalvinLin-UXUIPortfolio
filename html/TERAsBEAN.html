            <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>TERAs BEAN, an independent coffee shop, faces the challenge of competing against large corporations, with a primary focus on catering to university students. The goal is to create a welcoming, engaging space for all customers.</p>

            </h2>
            <br>
                <p>To gain insights into customer interactions at TERAs BEAN, our team, including Matthew, Alexandra, and myself, conducted on-site observations. We noticed that many customers, mostly university students, used the space for studying or work. Unfortunately, some potential customers walked in and out without ordering due to a small and easily overlooked menu and the coffee shop's limited online presence.</p>

                Collaborating with Noah, Matthew, and Jasper, we created a user journey map to visualize the typical TERAs BEAN experience for a student like Noah. This mapping process identified pain points and positive interactions, informing our solution.

            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our team organized a participatory workshop with SFU students to uncover their needs and frustrations when studying or working at cafes. The workshop consisted of four components: initial screening, moodboard creation, study space tier ranking, and speed ideation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our findings highlighted key preferences, including the importance of seating variety, access to power outlets, good hygiene, and ample natural lighting. Students disliked cubicles and areas with heavy foot traffic, as well as distractions such as loud music.

            <h2>Our Solution </h2>
            <br>
            <p>To address the identified pain points, we designed a table reservation system that reduces uncertainty when finding study spaces. The system allows users to choose areas based on their preferences, including environmental lighting, seating capacity, and access to natural light and power outlets.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Creating a new app that is both functional and useful can be difficult. During the initial phase, our group faced a lot of challenges by aiming to be useful to everybody. This was a case of "if you design for everyone you design for no one". We wanted to tackle all of the problems that caused users to avoid donating to charities, but in our attempt to solve this problem, we added too much unecessary clutter on our app. 
            </p>

        <div class="item">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            We were able to identify issues with our proposal before we began getting too deep into our development phase. This helped our group pivot our idea and focus more on creating an app that helps make educational donations as easy as possible. Through feedback and user testing, we were able to identify what potential users may or may not want, adjusting our final deliverables accordingly.

            <p>
            This project has taught me valuable skills in understanding that not every feature is a good feature. Despite identifying that transparency is an important feature for charitable organizations, including too much information detracts from the user experience overall.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Throughout this project, my team was excited to create an app that could potentially help a lot of people around the world. From idea pitching to user testing, our goal was to make donating a positive experience. We recognized that, despite users saying they may want one thing, often times, the actual implementation of a certain feature is not as well received as we may anticipate. Understanding that what users say and what users want are two fundamentally different things.
