            <h2>Who wants pizza?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Everybody loves pizza... right? Well, hopefully because my partner Pocholo and I designed a website that's all about pizza. Glow In The Dough is not your average pizza spot, instead, we are heavily inspired by the neon aesthetics that have dominated the 1920s to 1960s. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking inspiration from neon aesthetics and our shared love for pizza, Pocholo and I set out to build a website where customers could browse our pizza catalogue, as well as place orders. Glow In The Dough sets out to create a wave in the existing pizza scene. Our goal was to introduce some fun back to the pizza scene. No longer is pizza all about stone ovens and heirloom tomatoes, rather, it is a place worthy of that Instagram photo.</p>

            <h2>Designing a style guide</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To maintain consistency throughout our pages, Pocholo and I first set out to design a style guide. Within the style guide, we identified elements of our brand identity such as our mission and logo. Other important elements included text and branding colours. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After defining all of the native elements, we began building our interactive elements. These included in-text links, navigation links, buttons, text fields, as well as interactive images.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, we combined some elements together to form our main navigation bar, input fields, as well as a rating system.</p>

            <h2>Creating a skeleton</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With the style guide now complete, the next step was to plan out the skeleton of our website. This included how we wanted to lay out our information and how we plan out interactions to ensure that customers are able to use our website in a logical, predictable manner. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This stage consisted of planning out how every page will behave, most notably I was able to work on the <strong>about us, contact, cart, and checkout</strong> pages. I styled and wrote the code for a checkout form, making sure to include all of the necessary information required.</p>

            <h2>Creating assets</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As we began finalizing our project, Pocholo and I wanted to jazz things up with some promotions for our new website. Using Adobe Illustrator, I was able to create three promotional banners that we could fit into the carousel in our landing page.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The final touches we made to our project was to include all the proper assets. Because neither Pocholo nor myself are experts at making pizzas, we turned to AI to help generate our thumbnails. In addition, we also added a system for customers to rate our pizzas, find our location by embedding a map, as well as adding simple JavaScript to notify when an order has been placed.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The biggest challenges that Pocholo and I faced were creating a new company to design for. We were both well versed in creating solutions, but building a brand was an unfamiliar territory for us. Another challenge we faced was providing users with proper feedback on their interactions, specifically on the checkout pages.</p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The solution we found for our lack of experience designing a new company was to explore different company websites. We wanted to find inspiration from existing websites in order to help guide our project. In the end, we discovered that we wanted to design in the domain of food, specifically highly customizable food like pizza.
                <br>
                Providing feedback on interactions was challenging, especially due to only using HTML and CSS. We experimented with different CSS animations to try to find the correct interaction for our purposes. However, CSS and its limitations did not allow us to fully solve our issues, so instead, Pocholo began looking at Javascript popups. Javascript ended up being the exact tool we needed for the interaction we had in mind.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Through working on this project, I had my initial experience working with Git through GitKraken. The use of Git allowed me to further develop my collaborative work. Learning version control was pivotal in my development as a web developer, as it allowed me to store multiple branches in order to minimize losing my work.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The brand building design allowed me to further develop my good habits for collaborative work. The introduction of Git in this project, as well as using a style guide kept me on track and consistent throughout my work. This allowed Pocholo and I to be able to complete our work knowing that the website will be consistent through and through. Through tackling our challenges, we were able to develop our research and observation skills, as well as develop a foundation in Javascript for future projects.</p>
